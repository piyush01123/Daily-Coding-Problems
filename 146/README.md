This question was asked by BufferBox.

Given a binary tree where all nodes are either 0 or 1, prune the tree so that subtrees containing all 0s are removed.

For example, given the following tree:
```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 0   0

```
should be pruned to:
```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    /
   1
```
