title: "Maximum sum path in a triangular array"

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. For example, [[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]] represents the triangle:
```
  1
 2 3
1 5 1
```
We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 `->` 3 `->` 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.


My Solution(C++):
```
