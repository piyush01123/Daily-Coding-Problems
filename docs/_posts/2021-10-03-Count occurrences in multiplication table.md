This problem was asked by Apple.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

| 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |

| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |
```
And there are 4 12's in the table.


My Solution(Python):
```

def numOccurMultTable(N: int, X: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        if N%i==0 and N//i<=(i+1):
            count+=1
    return count

print(numOccurMultTable(6, 12))
```
